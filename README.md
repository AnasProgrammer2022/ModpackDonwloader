This is a simple code that allows you to download and install your mopacks.
Its like [Modrinth Pack to Zip Converter](https://jamie.codeberg.page/mrpack-to-zip/@master/) but it happens locally on your device!
That doesn't mean there is nothing special about it, it has (or will have) some features:
  (In progress) The ability to download multiple modpacks and mods alltogether.
  (In progress) The ability to install the mods and the modpacks automatically with no efforts.
  (In progress) I dont know what else should i add.
Right now, the program is still in beta and its just an ugly command program with no UI, and it will be fully released once all "In progress" things come true.
